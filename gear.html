            <td>A <strong>Tackle Box</strong> is a box or container used for the storage of fishing supplies.<br>
            Many fisherman carry things line extra line, bobbers, weights, hooks, etc.</td>

            <td>Fishing Pole</td>
            <td>A <strong>Fishing Pole</strong> is used commonly to catch fish.<br> A fishing pole could be any kind of pole with string and a hook on it that you could use to catch a fish. 
            </td>

            <td>Fishing Line</td>
            <td><strong>Fishing Line</strong> is attached to a fishing pole, <br>When a fish bites on the hook attached to the other end of the line, <br>it is the <strong>fishing line's</strong> job to not break under pressure of the fish.
            <br> There are diffrent line thicknesses and strengths for diffrent kinds of fish.</td>
            <td><img src="pictures\fishingline1.jpg" alt="image is not available" border=3 height=100 width=150 class="enlarge" height="100" width="100"></td>

            <td>Hook</td>
            <td><strong>Hooks</strong> are attached to the fishing line,<br>This is the piece of equipment that will <strong>hook</strong> the fish and make it catchable.
            <br> Hook sizes vary depending on the size of fish you are fishing for. </td>
            <td><img src="pictures\fishinghook1.jpg" alt="image is not available" border=3 height=100 width=150 class="enlarge" height="100" width="100"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Bobber</td>
            <td><strong>Bobbers</strong> are devices that you attach to fishing line.<br>When you cast into the water, the bobber will float, thus suspending your hook underwater but not allowing it to sink to the bottem. 
            <br>There are a couple diffrent kinds of bobbers, but the concept very simular for them all.</td>
            <td><img src="pictures\fishingbobber1.jpg" alt="image is not available" border=3 height=100 width=150 class="enlarge" height="100" width="100"></td>

        <tr>
            <td>Reel</td>
            <td><strong>Reels</strong> are devices that are attached to <underline>both the fishing pole and fishing line<br></underline> There is a handle on the reel, and when you spin it it will neatly reel in your fishing line, or cast more out.<br>
            This makes it possible to set the length of line you want to let out, instead of always having a certain amount of line out.</td>
            <td><img src="pictures\fishingreel1.jpg" alt="image is not available" border=3 height=100 width=150 class="enlarge" height="100" width="100"></td>

        <tr>
            <td>Weights</td>
            <td>Many fishermen attach <strong>Weights</strong> to their fishing line near the hook and below the bobber. <br>
            This assures that the fishing line will sink to the lowest point it can go, it also allows you to cast farther.</td>
            <td><img src="pictures\fishingweight1.jpg" alt="image is not available" border=3 height=100 width=150 class="enlarge" height="100" width="100"></td>
